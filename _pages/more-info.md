I grew up in Calais in France. I came to Paris to join the training which was then the only bachelor's degree in bioinformatics preparing for research. The Paris-Saclay master's degree then allowed me to improve my skills in theoretical computer science and to have a complementary perspective on data analysis. I found there the chance for an internship in systems biology in a computer science lab, continued by the doctorate.

## A glimpse of my nature :

My main personality trait is certainly curiosity. From architecture to linguistics, from biology to history... I like wandering through various topics but also, in a more palpable way, through various landscapes during hikes (combined with the pleasure of photography, as you can guess from this website section headers). I'm not able to play tennis anymore but in default I like following tennis and rugby news. I also cook a lot and I really enjoy sharing good dishes. I look forward to continuing my discovery of new places, countries and landscapes, new people and ways of life.

I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : a chronic illness disrupts my daily life in an always unpredictable way, but that hasn't stopped me from getting here! Just don't be surprised by my energy and ability changes depending on the day or hour. Sometimes hopping and full of life, then being unable to move and speak properly... My body is on strike and negotiations are not always in my favor.
