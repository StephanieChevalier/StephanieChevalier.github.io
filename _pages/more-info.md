I grew up in Calais in France. I came to Paris to join the training which was then the only bachelor's degree in bioinformatics made for research. I moved to Paris-Saclay for the master's degree to further my skills in theoretical computer science while gaining new insights notably on data analysis. I found there the chance for an internship in systems biology in a computer science lab, continued by the doctorate that I am currently completing.

## A glimpse of my nature :

I am open-minded, introvert but very social. In my free time, I cook a lot and I really enjoy sharing good dishes. I love hiking and going agility with my dog and, in default of playing, I like to follow the tennis and rugby news. I like to travel to discover new places and landscapes, new people and ways of life.

I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : a chronic illness disrupts my daily life in an always unpredictable way, but that hasn't stopped me from getting here ! Just don't be surprised by my energy changes depending on the day or hour. I don't always have the same strength to overcome the pain and fatigue that strike me.
