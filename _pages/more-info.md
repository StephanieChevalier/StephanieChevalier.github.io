My main personality trait is certainly <important>curiosity</important>. For **biology** and **computer science** of course, but also for **pedagogy**, **urbanism**, **architecture**, **linguistics**, **history**... I like wandering through various topics but also, in a more palpable way, through various landscapes during **hikes** (combined with the pleasure of **photography**, as you can guess from this website section headers). I'm not able to play tennis anymore but in default I like following **tennis** and **rugby** news. I also cook a lot and I really enjoy **sharing good dishes**. I look forward to continuing my discovery of **new places, countries and landscapes, new people and ways of life**.

I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : an orphan disease greatly limits my daily life and disrupts it in an always unpredictable way. But that hasn't stopped me from getting here! Just don't be surprised by my energy and ability changes depending on the day or hour. Bouncy and full of life whenever I can, but often being unable to move and speak properly... My body is on strike and negotiations are mostly not in my favor.
