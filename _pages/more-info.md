<div style="padding-top:0.5em;"></div>

My main personality trait is certainly <span class=important>curiosity</span>. For **biology** and **computer science** of course, but also for **pedagogy**, **linguistics**, **history**, **urbanism**... I like wandering through various topics but also, in a more palpable way, through various landscapes during **hikes** (combined with the pleasure of **photography**, as you can guess from this website section headers).
I can't play tennis as often anymore, but I enjoy keeping up with tennis and rugby news. ...and perhaps I must also admit that, above all in daily life, I love cooking and sharing good meals!
As expectations, I look forward to continuing my exploration of new places and landscapes, especially to connect with new people and ways of life.

<!-- I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : an orphan disease greatly limits my daily life and disrupts it in an always unpredictable way. Don't be surprised by my changes in energy and ability depending on the day or hour: from being lively and bouncy whenever I can, to struggling with basic tasks like walking and talking. But this challenge hasn't prevented me from making it this far! -->

I particularly cherish every little joyful moment, probably because of a challenge I face: an orphan disease significantly limits my daily life and disrupts it in unpredictable ways. Don't be surprised if my energy and abilities shift from one moment to the next — ranging from being lively and spirited to struggling with basic tasks like walking or speaking. However, this challenge hasn't stopped me from reaching where I am today!

<span style="font-size:smaller;">To salute my (great) statistician colleagues:</span>  
<span style="font-size:smaller;">**"To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of."**
