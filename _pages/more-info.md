<div style="padding-top:0.5em;"></div>

My main personality trait is certainly <span class=important>curiosity</span>. For **biology** and **computer science** of course, but also for **pedagogy**, **linguistics**, **history**, **urbanism**... I like wandering through various topics but also, in a more palpable way, through various landscapes during **hikes** (combined with the pleasure of **photography**, as you can guess from this website section headers). I'm not able to play tennis anymore but in default I like following **tennis** and **rugby** news. I also cook a lot and I really enjoy **sharing good dishes**. I look forward to continuing my discovery of **new places, countries and landscapes, new people and ways of life**.

I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : an orphan disease greatly limits my daily life and disrupts it in an always unpredictable way. Don't be surprised by my changes in energy and ability depending on the day or hour: from being lively and bouncy whenever I can, to struggling with basic tasks like walking and talking. But this challenge hasn't prevented me from making it this far!

<span style="font-size:smaller;">**"The scientist is not the person who gives the right answers, it is the one who asks the right questions."**  
Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss</span>

<span style="font-size:smaller;">**"A woman is human. She is not better, wiser, stronger, more intelligent, more creative, or more responsible than a man. Likewise, she is never less. Equality is a given. A woman is human."**  
Vera Nazarian</span>

<span style="font-size:smaller;">**"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'"**  
Isaac Asimov</span>

<span style="font-size:smaller;">To salute my (great) statistician colleagues:</span> 
<span style="font-size:smaller;">**"To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of."**  
Ronald Fisher</span>
