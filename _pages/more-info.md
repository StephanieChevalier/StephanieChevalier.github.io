I grew up in Calais in France. I came to Paris to join the training which was then the only bachelor's degree in bioinformatics made for research. I moved to Paris-Saclay for the master's degree to further my skills in theoretical computer science while gaining new insights notably on data analysis. I found there the chance for an internship in systems biology in a computer science lab, continued by the doctorate that I am currently completing.

## A glimpse of my nature :

I am open-minded, introvert but very social. In my free time, I cook a lot and I really enjoy sharing good dishes. I love hiking and going agility with my dog and, in default of playing, I like to follow the tennis and rugby news. I like to travel to discover new places and landscapes, new people and ways of life.

I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : a chronic illness disrupts my daily life in an always unpredictable way, but that hasn't stopped me from getting here! Just don't be surprised by my energy and ability changes depending on the day or hour. Sometimes bouncing around and full of life, then being unable to move and speak properly. My body is on strike and negotiations are not always in my favor.
