I grew up in Calais in France. I came to Paris-Diderot (Paris-Cit√©) to join the training which was then the only Bachelor's degree in bioinformatics preparing for research and I continued with a Master in Paris-Saclay. I could see different issues of bioinformatics, from **NGS analysis** to **systems biology** via **structural bioinformatics**, while becoming aware of the challenges of **experiment reproducibility**, **data accessibility** and **theoretical computer science** difficulty.

## A glimpse of my nature :

My main personality trait is certainly **<important>curiosity</important>**. For **biology** and **computer science** of course, but also for **pedagogy**, **urbanism**, **architecture**, **linguistics**, **history**... I like wandering through various topics but also, in a more palpable way, through various landscapes during **hikes** (combined with the pleasure of **photography**, as you can guess from this website section headers). I'm not able to play tennis anymore but in default I like following **tennis** and **rugby** news. I also cook a lot and I really enjoy **sharing good dishes**. I look forward to continuing my discovery of **new places, countries and landscapes, new people and ways of life**.

I greatly savor every little nice moment due to a particular challenge : an orphan disease disrupts my daily life in an always unpredictable way, but that hasn't stopped me from getting here! Just don't be surprised by my energy and ability changes depending on the day or hour. Sometimes hopping and full of life, then being unable to move and speak properly... My body is on strike and negotiations are not always in my favor.
