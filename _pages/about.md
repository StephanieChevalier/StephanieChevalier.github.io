I am currently a bioinformatics postdoctoral fellow in translational medicine at Servier,
<span class=important>working on a systems biology approach to prioritize drug combination strategies</span>.
My research is involved in the challenging issue of modeling biological systems and predicting behaviors under perturbations to support therapeutic solution research, via **biological knowledge graphs and dynamical models of biological regulations**.

I am highly motivated by the translation of fundamental research into health care advances, with a particular interest in multisystemic disorders.
<!-- I have a special affinity for the holistic approach of systems biology to explore biological phenomena.-->
During my training, I could successively approach complementary bioinformatics perspectives: the challenge of data integration, NGS analysis, structural analysis for drug design, and finally, the one of complex biological systems analysis and modelling.
