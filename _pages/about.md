<div class="highlight-box">
  As a bioinformatics postdoctoral researcher in translational medicine at Servier,
  <span class=important>I focus on leveraging systems biology to prioritize drug combination strategies.</span>
  My research is involved in the challenging issue of modeling biological systems and predicting behaviors under perturbations to support therapeutic solution research,
  via <span style="font-weight:bold;">biological knowledge graphs and dynamical models of biological regulations</span>.
</div>

<span class=important>I am highly motivated by the translation of fundamental research into health care advances.</span>

In particular,
**I have a keen interest in neuroimmune and infectious diseases**.
These conditions, **with their multisystemic impacts**, remain poorly understood at a fundamental level, leading to not only a lack of effective therapeutic solutions but also limited symptomatic relief for patients.
My fascination for this research area is twofold:
- As a citizen, it represents a pressing public health challenge with significant potential.
- As a researcher, it promises captivating multisystemic explorations that go beyond compartmentalized health studies. Addressing these conditions requires integrating infectiology and immunology while studying physiological dysfunctions that likely span central and peripheral neurology, gastroenterology, cardiology... but also the fascinating complex interactions of metabolic dysregulations with potentially all systems.

<!-- I am highly motivated by the translation of fundamental research into health care advances, with a particular interest in multisystemic disorders. -->
<!-- I have a special affinity for the holistic approach of systems biology to explore biological phenomena.-->
<!-- During my training, I could successively approach complementary bioinformatics perspectives: the challenge of data integration, NGS analysis, structural analysis for drug design, and finally, the one of complex biological systems analysis and modelling. -->
